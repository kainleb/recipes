Drop the ziti. Three minutes before the pasta is al dente, toss the broccoli florets directly into the boiling water with the pasta.</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Sear the Chicken: While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet with a splash of olive oil over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and sear until golden and cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Build the Base: In that same pan, turn heat to medium and add a tablespoon of butter. Saute the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes for about 1 minute (until fragrant, not brown).</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Deglaze: Pour in the white wine to scrape up the brown bits (fond) from the chicken. Let it reduce by half. Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer for 3-4 minutes.</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">The "Melt" Technique: Turn the heat to low. Whisk in the remaining cold butter one cube at a time. This creates an emulsion rather than just "oily" melted butter.</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss and Emulsify: Drain the pasta and broccoli (remembering to save some pasta water!). Add them and the chicken into the skillet. Toss vigorously while sprinkling in the cheese.</li><li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pro Tip: If it looks too dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water. The starch in the water combines with the cheese and butter to create that velvety "melt" sauce.</li></ol></section></main></body></html>
